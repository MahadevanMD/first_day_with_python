First Day with Python
=====================

[![Gitter team chat](https://badges.gitter.im/yungyuc/first_day_with_python.png)](https://gitter.im/first_day_with_python/Lobby)

This is a bootcamp to introduce Python to people who have zero experience with
computer programming.  The course is exercise-centric.  Students will
experience Python by using their own hands.

It is s full-day bootcamp divided into two parts.  In the morning it uses half
an hour to deliver minimal explanation for Python, and outline the course.  It
is followed by the first session of two hours.  Lunch break is one hour.  In
the afternoon, there is the second session of two hours, too.  The formal
course ends but the bootcamp ends after another hour of free discussions.  More
detail of the outline can be found in the [introduction
notebook](introduction.ipynb#Course-Outline).

This repository hosts the course materials and provides communication among
instructors, collaborators, and students.  Open an issue if you want to contact
